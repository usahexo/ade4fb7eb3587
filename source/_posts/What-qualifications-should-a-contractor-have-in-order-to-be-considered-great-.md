#  What qualifications should a contractor have in order to be considered great? 

There are a few qualifications that are needed in order to be considered great by many. One of the most important is being able to complete the project successfully and on time. Other important qualifications include having excellent communication skills, being able to follow instructions, and having a high level of professionalism. 

Being able to complete the project successfully and on time is one of the most important qualifications for a contractor. This means ensuring that all of the materials are ordered and delivered on time, that the work is completed correctly and within the budget, and that any issues or concerns are addressed in a timely manner. 

 Excellent communication skills are another important qualification. This means being able to listen carefully, understand what is needed, ask appropriate questions, and communicate effectively with everyone involved in the project. Contractors who can communicate well are more likely to avoid misunderstandings and costly mistakes. 

Being able to follow instructions is also important. This means paying close attention to detail, reading all of the instructions carefully, asking clarifying questions if needed, and completing all tasks according to plan. Contractors who can follow instructions are more likely to meet deadlines and stay within budget. 

Lastly, having a high level of professionalism is key. This includes arriving on time, dressing appropriately for the job, being courteous to others involved in the project, and completing all tasks in a timely and accurate manner. Contractors who display good professionalism are more likely to be invited back for future projects.

#  How can you be sure that the contractor is reliable? 

There is no foolproof way to ensure that a contractor is reliable, but there are a few steps you can take to minimize the risk. First, ask for referrals from friends or family who have used the contractor's services in the past. Review online reviews to see what other people have said about the contractor's work. If possible, visit jobs the contractor has completed in the past to get a sense of their work quality. Finally, get a written estimate from the contractor and make sure they are insured and licensed.

#  What are some things to watch out for when hiring a contractor? 

Hiring a contractor is a big decision. It’s important to be aware of the things to watch out for before making your choice.

First, make sure the contractor is licensed and insured. If something goes wrong, you don’t want to be responsible.

Second, check references and reviews. A good contractor will have plenty of positive reviews.

Third, get a written estimate. This will help protect you if the contractor tries to charge more after the job is completed.

Fourth, make sure the contract includes a payment schedule and outlines the work that will be done. This will help avoid any confusion down the road.

Finally, be sure to inspect the work when it’s finished. If there are any problems, address them immediately so they can be fixed.

#  How much should you expect to pay for the services of a great contractor?

Finding the right contractor to help with your home improvement project can be tricky. Not only do you need to find someone who has the skills and experience to do the job right, but you also need to find someone you can trust. And, of course, you want to find someone who won't break the bank.

So how much should you expect to pay for the services of a great contractor? The answer depends on a number of factors, including the type of work being done, the size of the project, and the location of the job.

But a good rule of thumb is to expect to pay between 10 and 15 percent of the total project cost for contracting services. So if your project costs $10,000, you can expect to pay between $1,000 and $1,500 for contracting services.

Of course, there are always exceptions. For example, if you're hiring a contractor to do a minor repair or remodel job that can be completed in a day or two, you may only need to pay a few hundred dollars. And if you're hiring a contractor for a large-scale renovation project that will take weeks or months to complete, you may end up paying more than 15 percent of the total cost.

But in general, 10 to 15 percent is a good guideline for what you can expect to pay for contracting services. So when budgeting for your next home improvement project, be sure to include this cost in your calculations.

#  What is the best way to find a great contractor?

There are a few key things you can do to find a great contractor for your next home improvement project. First, ask around for referrals. Friends and family are a great resource for finding trustworthy contractors.

Another way to find a good contractor is to check out online reviews. Sites like Angie's List and Yelp are great places to start your search. Be sure to read reviews from both past clients and industry experts.

Finally, it's always a good idea to meet with potential contractors in person before hiring them. This will give you a chance to see their work in person and ask any questions you may have.
